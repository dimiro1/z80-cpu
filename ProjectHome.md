# **Z80 CPU Emulation in Java** #

A general purpose implementation of the ZiLOG Z80 microprocessor core in Java.  This core accurately emulates all valid op-codes while attempting to cover all undocumented features.

The emulator features:

  * All standard instructions
  * All flags, including unused bits
  * All undocumented instructions I can find including IX / IY as HL, missing shifts, bit twiddling
  * Accurate T state timings
  * Simulated R register
  * IFF1 and IFF2 handling
  * NMI handling
