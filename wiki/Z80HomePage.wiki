=*Z80 Microprocessor Java Emulation*=

A general purpose implementation of the ZiLOG Z80 microprocessor core in Java.  This core accurately emulates all valid op-codes while attempting to cover all undocumented features.

The emulator features:

 * All standard instructions
 * All flags, including unused bits
 * All undocumented instructions I can find including IX / IY as HL, missing shifts, bit twiddling
 * Accurate T state timings
 * Simulated R register
 * IFF1 and IFF2 handling
 * NMI handling
